Here is the code for my MELON gamejame entry, Boo! You play as a ghost who is tired of party goers not letting you rest! Your goal is to get revenge and ghostify them all! The theme was Music, so you must scare people to the beat of the song.

Boo! was created in 3 days using my own frameworks and libraries; such as Bullfrog, Reco, and BetterWait.
